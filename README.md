# Dataset Backup for Cybersecurity Data

This repository contains a **backup of the data** generated from the Kaggle dataset: [Cybersecurity Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/macisalvsalv/cybersecurity-dataset).  

The dataset was originally created as part of the project: [CyberIntelLake](https://github.com/MaciaKing/CyberIntelLake), which implements the full **data processing logic**. This backup only includes the **input and output data**, providing traceability for how the Kaggle dataset was generated.

The data processing follows the standard **Raw → Silver → Gold** methodology:  

- **Raw**: Original, unprocessed input data.  
- **Silver**: Cleaned and partially transformed data.  
- **Gold**: Final, fully processed dataset ready for analysis or use.

This structure ensures reproducibility and transparency of the dataset generation process.
